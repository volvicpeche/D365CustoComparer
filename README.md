# D365 CustoComparer

This repository contains tools for comparing customizations in Dynamics 365.  
The `CrmConnectionTool` project targets .NET Framework 4.8 and provides the existing Windows Forms tooling.  

`CompareFormTool` is a placeholder console project that may evolve into a modern .NET implementation. It currently targets **.NET 6** so it can be compiled with stable tooling. The project only prints a placeholder message.
